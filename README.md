BA-Simula  is an open source numerical computational code for simulating 5MW NREL spar-type floating wind turbine but the code is flexible for further changes to implement for other spar-type wind turbines with different characteristics.

To run the model follow these steps:

1- Download BA-Simula folder to you computer.

2- Define wind turbine and invironmental properties for each modul (note that BA-Simula defualt properties are set for NREL 5MW spar-type floatint wind turbine)

3- Set the initial conditions of motion and run duration time in DES function and run the model from matlab editor section.

4- For extracting motion response frequency spectrum first save the output of BA-Simula as a .mat file then read the file from FFT time history function. Next choose each mode of motion and run the function to see the results.
